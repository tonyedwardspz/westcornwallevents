Although it is an old tradition, it was revived by a group of artists and local schools in 1991 in order to remember the local area heritage. The festival is ten days long, culminating in the Mazey weekend and notably Mazey Day on the Saturday.</p>\r\n                                <p>Golowan was one of the last mid summer festivals practiced in Cornwall. In the 1890\xE2\x80\x99s, the Penzance government outlawed the festival due to the rising insurance premiums for the towns business community. Traditionally the towns streets were lined with alight tar barrels which were paraded around. The surrounding hills had bonfires set at the top, throwing dancing shadows all around mounts bay and beyond.</p>\r\n                                \r\n                                <p>The modern Golowan is arguably a little less dangerous. The celebration of the area's arts and culture attracts thousands of visitors to West Cornwall from local towns and as far as the Asian continent and further. The Golowan Festival brings around a million pounds to the local economy. The core of the celebrations is Mazey Day, when the streets are filled with market stalls and entertainers and the town's school children parade up and down Market Jew Street, setting out from St.Johns Hall, holding aloft large paper mache and wicker creations. It truly is a sight to behold, with some figures being larger than the building around them. The weekend begins with Mazey Eve and ends with the Quay Fair.</p>\r\n                                <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n                                                                \r\n                                <h4>Golowan Festival 2015 - Dates to Remember</h4>\r\n                                <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n                                <ul>\r\n                                    <li>\r\n                                        <strong>Mazey Eve</strong>- Friday 26th June 2015\r\n                                        <br />Penglaz, the Penzance obby oss is let loose around the quay area, leading a procession of dancers and musicians.

You can explore this world famous open-air theatre created from a cliff side at Porthcurno by Rowena Cade. The sub tropical gardens are an established favorite, especially for gardeners with a taste for the exotic. The succulent plants thrive on the open cliff side providing an added dash of colour to the Minack all year round. This is also an on site cafe, allowing guests to have lunch looking out over the theatre and cliffs.                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\"Minack\" in Cornish means a rocky place and the black headed crag below the theatre has always drawn local fishermen. Until the 1930&rsquo;s they had the gorse filled gully to themselves and the cliffs echoed to the cries of gulls not actors.</p>\r\n                    <p>From 1931 until she died in 1983 the Minack Theatre was planned, built and financed by one woman - Rowena Cade.</p>\r\n                    <p>Photo from\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://www.minack.com/\" title=\"the minack open air theatre\" target=\"_blank\">www.minack.com</a></p>"},
