    ' We recently rebuilt the event submission system from scratch. It would be great 
    ' if you could complete a very short 
    a href="http://goo.gl/forms/eLb0qIzwAj" 4 question survey
    ' . It should take no more than a minute and all responses are completely anonymous. It will help to make the site as useful as possible for the community.
  p Many thanks
